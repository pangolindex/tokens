# Pangolin Token Assets

This repository is a comprehensive collection of token assets for pooled tokens on Pangolin.

Such a large collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so feel free to add your token.

Token logos are stored according to their Avalanche address under the `assets/` directory. 
Token images are stored in the format `<token-address>/logo_24.png` and `<token-address>/logo_48.png`.

## Add Yours
1. Create a new directory named using your [checksum token address](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.7.1/web3-utils.html#tochecksumaddress).
2. Add your 24x24 token image as a file named `logo_24.png` inside the directory.
3. Add your 48x48 token image as a file named `logo_48.png` inside the directory.
4. No image should be larger than 10 KB.
5. Token should be [verified on an explorer like snowtrace.io](https://snowtrace.io/verifyContract).
6. Create a PR titled `Add [TOKEN_NAME]` to the `main` branch.
