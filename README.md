# Pangolin Token Assets

This repository is a comprehensive collection of token assets for pooled tokens on Pangolin.

Such a large collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so _feel free to add your token_.

This repo is intended to be similar to Trust Wallet's asset repository. Token logos are stored according to their Avalanche address under the `assets` directory. Tokens are stored in the format `<token-address>/logo.png`.

## Add Yours
Create a PR adding your token logo to the `assets` folder. Create a new folder with your token address (with properly formatted capitalization) and add a `logo.png` file inside the directory. The image must be no larger than 256px by 256px.

## Disclaimer
Pangolin team allows anyone to submit new assets to this repository. However, this does not mean that we are in direct partnership with all of the projects.

Pangolin team will reject projects that are deemed as scam or fraudulent after careful review. Pangolin team reserves the right to change the terms of asset submissions at any time due to changing market conditions, risk of fraud, or any other factors we deem relevant.
